# Project Summary
This project showcases how machine learning is used for outlier detection in a pharmaceutical environment.

The goal of this project is to characterize how the features impact the target, especially where outliers have the highest chance of occuring. Probability charts were used to identify the optimal business operational targets for the selected features.

A simple regression analysis was conducted just to see the non-linear relationship between one of the features with the target. A more involved classification model building exercise with model selection and cross validation is the focus of this project.
