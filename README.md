# Overview
Here are my data science and machine learning sample projects, using python packages such as Pandas and SciKit-Learn! 


## [Linear Regression with Gradient Descent: Built from Scratch](https://github.com/rosscleung/Projects/tree/master/Built%20from%20Scratch%20Linear%20Regression)
* It's good to know what goes on underneath the hood for machine learning algorithms. Starting with the most basic one, Linear Regression, I've built a class object that can do Linear Regression while using Gradient Descent for minimizing the cost function. The results of my self built Linear Regression are exactly the same as the implementation in SciKit-Learn.

## [NLP - Social Meda App Multi-Label Classification](https://github.com/rosscleung/Projects/tree/master/NLP%20-%20Social%20Meda%20App%20Multi-Label%20Classification)
* Using some real data from a social media app, I recreate what I think is their multi-label classification and recommendation technique.

## [NLP - Classifying Email Authors](https://github.com/rosscleung/Projects/tree/master/NLP%20-%20classifying%20email%20authors)
* A fun, quick exercise to show how a commonly used NLP classifer (Naive Bayes) can identify the author of an email from two of my colleagues.
* This technique can be applied to more than just identifying authors. It can be used to develop a model to identify spam emails or do sentiment analysis.

## [Biologics Outlier Detection](https://github.com/rosscleung/Projects/tree/master/Biologics%20Outliers%20Detection)
* Pharmaceutical production outlier detection
* Used data visualization and supervised machine learning to characterize the probability of an outlier occuring (Logistic Regression)

## [Biologics Yield Study](https://github.com/rosscleung/Projects/tree/master/Biologics%20Yield%20Study)
* Comprehensive study on what impacts a drug's production yield
* Used feature selection, regression models, and classification models to study the data

## [Neural Network MNIST Digit Set](https://github.com/rosscleung/Projects/tree/master/Neural%20Network%20-%20MNIST%20digit%20set)
* An example showing a multi-layer perceptron (back propagation neural network) algorithm that is newly added to SciKit-Learn 0.18 used to recognize images with numbers on them, i.e. the famous MNIST digit set.

## [Predicting Market Demand](https://github.com/rosscleung/Projects/tree/master/Predicting%20Market%20Demand)
* A regression exercise to fill in missing market demand data that is essential in an investment decision

## [Data Processing Automation Script](https://github.com/rosscleung/Projects/tree/master/Data%20Processing%20Automation%20Script)
* Python script used in conjunction with SQL to process and clean data to cut down the time needed to process the data. No machine learning here.

## [Tutorial Notebooks](https://github.com/rosscleung/Projects/tree/master/Tutorial%20notebooks)
* Smaller notebooks that showcase concepts that I think others might find valuable, topics include:
	* Custom Transformer, Pipeline, and FeatureUnion
	* Nested Cross Validation
	* Unsupervised Learning Performance - Silhouette Score Analysis
	* Multi-Label Classification
